<dt><b><em> Ricotta Cheese:</em></b></dt>
<dd><q> Ricotta is an Italian whey cheese
It is made from sheep, cow, goat, or Italian water buffalo milk whey left over from the production of cheese.
Like other whey cheeses, it is made by coagulating the proteins that remain after the casein has been used to make cheese, notably albumin and globulin.
