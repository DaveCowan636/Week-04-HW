Week 04 Homework
I had a lot of struggles with the part of the homework this week.  Trying to get flow between two diffirent pages
was very difficult for me, and adding an image on the second page took me forever to get right.
I had a lot of committs to my reposit in order to keep trying the codes, I still think something is wrong, when I use the
website assigned by github it will not go back and forth between the links.  Yet when I put it direct from
atom into the web browser it works going back and for between the two pages and shows the image I wanted
on the second page.  I also noticed I had to close/ open my pages alot and even restart my computer before it would
register some of the changes I had made on atom and uploaded to my respitory.  Sometimes it would be there withing
moments and other times I was having a hard time getting it to show at all, even though I commited it.

For my way back I looked at AOL.  Its first snap shot was taken on Dec 20th 1996.
It has now has been saved 47,593 times to date. It was pretty interesting to go back and see 
how diffirent the setup and interaction was then, I still remember being in 8th grade when AOL first
came out and using dial up internet for our timed sessions online.
